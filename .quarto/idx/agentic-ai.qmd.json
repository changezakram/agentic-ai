Unlike traditional AI systems that simply respond to input, Agentic AI systems can reason, plan, act, and adapt autonomously. This blog post will walk you through the basics of Agentic AI—what it is, how it works, how it differs from other AI approaches, and why it matters.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Agentic AI?\n\n**Agentic AI** refers to intelligent systems that act with **intent, autonomy, and adaptability** to achieve defined goals. Unlike traditional AI, these agents not only respond to commands but also plan, decide, and act proactively — often without step-by-step human direction.\n\nThey can perceive their environment, break down complex objectives into manageable tasks, interact with tools and APIs, and adapt their behavior based on feedback and context. In essence, they function as **proactive collaborators**, not just reactive assistants.\n\nGoogle Cloud defines agentic AI as systems with **memory, planning, and tool-use capabilities**, operating in dynamic feedback loops. IBM and McKinsey emphasize their role as **organizational actors** — capable of taking initiative, making decisions aligned with goals, and integrating seamlessly with human teams.\n\n> *“Agentic AI systems are dynamic, goal-seeking entities that can plan and act autonomously.” — IBM*\n\n---\n\n## How It Differs From Traditional and Generative AI\n\n| **AI Type**       | **Behavior**                               | **Limitation**                         |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Traditional AI** | Rule-based or ML-based automation          | Rigid, task-specific                   |\n| **Generative AI**  | Generates text, images, audio, or video using LLMs, diffusion, GANs, etc. | Reactive: one prompt → one response   |\n| **Agentic AI**     | Goal-oriented planning and action          | Proactive, multi-step autonomy        |\n\nIBM describes the progression clearly: generative AI creates content across modalities, while agentic AI **follows through** on tasks by interpreting ambiguous instructions, planning multi-step workflows, and taking initiative.\n\nMcKinsey further notes that agentic systems assume decision-making responsibilities by incorporating **context, risk, and organizational goals** into their actions.\n\n> *“Agentic AI combines generative power with goal decomposition, reasoning, and execution.” — IBM*\n\n---\n\n## How Agentic AI Works\n\nAgentic AI operates through a systematic process supported by distinct components. The process consists of sequential **steps**, while the components (or elements) enable and power those steps.\n\n### Steps in the Process:\n1. **Perceive** — The agent gathers and analyzes data from various sources to understand its environment and identify relevant patterns or entities.\n2. **Reason** — The agent formulates a plan, breaking the goal into actionable tasks based on context and knowledge.\n3. **Act** — The agent executes tasks by interacting with tools, APIs, and external systems.\n4. **Learn** — The agent monitors outcomes, collects feedback, and improves its strategies over time.\n5. **Adapt** — Over time, the agent refines its models and behavior to better meet organizational needs.\n\n### Key Components Enabling These Steps:\n- **Reasoning Engine** — Powers the reasoning step by understanding the context, planning, and making decisions. Often implemented with an LLM.\n- **Planner** — Breaks goals into specific, ordered tasks.\n- **Memory** — Stores and recalls context and historical interactions to inform decisions.\n- **Tool Use** — Interfaces with external software, APIs, and databases to execute actions.\n- **Feedback Loop** — Captures and incorporates results to improve performance over time.\n\nTogether, these components enable the agent to move through the steps effectively — perceiving, reasoning, acting, learning, and adapting.\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Use Cases\n\nAgentic AI is already transforming industries. Below are **adoption rates by sector** and key use case categories (adapted from Bornet et al., 2024):\n\n### 📊 Adoption of Agentic AI by Industry\n\n| **Industry Sector**            | **Approx.
