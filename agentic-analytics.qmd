## Overview

This guide explains the difference between **Generative BI (Gen BI)** and **Agentic Analytics**, with examples, use cases, roadmap, and example architectures.

---

## 🔷 What’s the difference?

| Feature | Generative BI | Agentic Analytics |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Definition** | Use of generative AI (e.g., LLMs) to make BI conversational and accessible | Use of autonomous AI agents to monitor, reason, and act |
| **Focus** | Natural language querying & insight generation | Autonomous problem-solving & action-taking |
| **User Role** | User asks → system answers | Agent acts → user reviews/overrides |
| **Tech Foundation** | LLMs, NLP, vector search | Agents, reasoning, orchestration, planning |
| **Goal** | Democratize data insights | Proactively optimize KPIs & take actions |

---

## Examples

### Generative BI      
- User asks: *"Show me revenue trends by region last quarter."*  
- NLP translates → SQL → dashboard or insight.  
- Tools: Microsoft Copilot in Power BI, Tableau GPT, ThoughtSpot Sage, Looker.

### Agentic Analytics        
- Agent monitors churn → detects anomaly → runs analysis → recommends retention campaign → optionally triggers it.  
- Tools: LangChain Agents, AutoGen, CrewAI, IBM Watson Decision Support.

## Use Cases in Banking

| Generative BI | Agentic Analytics |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Self-service dashboards and reports | Continuous KPI monitoring and autonomous adjustment |
| Natural-language queries on deposits, loans, churn | Detects anomalies and launches root cause analysis |
| Automated dashboards and narratives | Adjusts operations or triggers workflows autonomously |

---

## Roadmap: Maturity Journey

| Stage | Description | Example Outcome |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1. Traditional BI** | Static dashboards | “I can see my KPIs weekly.” |
| **2. Self-Service BI** | Business users build own reports | “I can slice & dice myself.” |
| **3. Generative BI** | NLP-driven, automated insights | “I can ask anything & get answers.” |
| **4. Augmented BI** | System suggests anomalies/trends | “It highlights what matters.” |
| **5. Agentic Analytics** | Agents monitor & act autonomously | “It adjusts operations proactively.” |
