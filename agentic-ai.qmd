# Introduction

AI systems are gaining autonomy. The latest wave—Agentic AI—doesn't just answer questions or generate content on command. These systems plan, decide, and act on their own to achieve goals you set. Instead of telling AI what to do at each step, you tell it what outcome you want and let it figure out the path.

This shift from reactive to proactive intelligence changes how organizations can deploy AI. Instead of building workflows around what the model can do in a single interaction, you can assign objectives and let the system figure out how to accomplish them. That capability is already reshaping operations in financial services, healthcare, customer support, and software development.

## What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems act with intent and autonomy to achieve defined goals. The key distinction: they don't just respond to commands—they pursue objectives.

This changes what you can hand off to AI. Traditional systems require you to orchestrate each step. Generative systems require you to prompt for each output. Agentic systems let you specify the outcome and trust the system to figure out how to get there.

> Take loan processing as an example. Traditional systems route applications through fixed checkpoints. A generative AI chatbot might answer questions about loan requirements. An agentic system actually processes the application—pulling credit data, verifying employment, calculating risk-adjusted pricing, checking compliance rules, and routing exceptions to human reviewers when needed. The difference isn't just scale. It's whether the system can navigate complexity without constant human intervention.


| **AI Type**       | **What It Does**                                               | **Key Limitation**                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Traditional AI    | Executes predefined rules or predictions from trained models   | Can't adapt to tasks outside its training scope             |
| Generative AI     | Creates content (text, images, code) based on learned patterns | Reactive: requires explicit prompts for each step           |
| Agentic AI        | Pursues goals through multi-step planning and decision-making  | Requires oversight to prevent unintended autonomous actions |

Agentic systems maintain context across interactions (memory), break complex goals into subtasks (planning), access external tools and data sources (tool use), and improve based on outcomes (learning). Earlier AI generations handled these separately—or couldn't do them at all.

# How Agentic AI Works

Agentic systems run in a continuous cycle—perceiving their environment, reasoning about options, planning actions, executing through tools, and learning from results. The cycle runs continuously, adapting as conditions change.

![**Figure:** Agents operate in a continuous action-feedback loop, using memory and reasoning to interact with external tools and data sources.](images/AI-Agents-Architecture.png)

**Perceive** — The agent pulls data from available sources: databases, APIs, document repositories, or user inputs. It keeps relevant context in memory from past interactions.

**Reason** — A reasoning engine (usually a large language model) analyzes the current state, evaluates options, and determines the best approach given the goal and constraints. It weighs tradeoffs, anticipates consequences, and selects strategies.

**Plan** — The planner breaks complex objectives into discrete tasks, sequences them logically, and identifies dependencies. For a loan approval goal, the agent might plan to: verify identity, pull credit history, calculate debt-to-income ratio, check against underwriting guidelines, and route to human review if red flags emerge. Each step depends on the previous one, and the agent adjusts the sequence if something fails.

**Act** — Tool-use capabilities let the agent execute planned tasks by interacting with external systems. It might call an identity verification API, query a credit bureau database, run a calculation, update a CRM record, or send a notification. The agent chooses which tools to use based on what each step requires.

**Learn** — The system captures outcomes and adjusts its behavior for next time. If a particular sequence of checks consistently flags false positives, the system refines its approach. If certain customer segments respond better to specific communication timing, the agent adapts its strategy.

Each interaction informs the next. A customer service agent might start with a standard response template, detect frustration in the customer's reply, shift to a different communication strategy, pull additional account context, and adjust its tone—all within a single conversation thread.

> These pieces—perception, reasoning, planning, action, learning—work together, not in isolation.

# Agentic Design Patterns

Agentic systems rely on core design patterns. Each solves a different problem, and real systems combine them.

![How agentic AI systems reflect, plan, use tools, and collaborate to solve complex tasks.](images/AgenticAI-Patterns.png)

## Reflection     
An agent that can't critique its own output is just automation with extra steps. Reflection lets agents evaluate and improve their outputs before finalizing them—the same quality check that humans do.

Research demonstrates that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 improve their outputs by ~20% through iterative self-feedback.^[1]^ The key is structured evaluation criteria—specific feedback on what needs improvement drives better refinements than generic critique.

**Best for:** Tasks where you need to check and improve quality before finalizing. It works well for regulatory reports, customer communications, and compliance documents that have clear quality standards.

![**Figure:** Reflection lets agents critique and improve their own output before delivering results—turning potential errors into learning opportunities.](images/reflection-pattern.png)

A customer service agent might review its drafted response for tone, clarity, and alignment with brand guidelines before sending. A credit analysis agent might validate whether its risk assessment considered all required factors and whether calculations are correct. Each iteration catches errors that would otherwise reach customers or regulators.

> Without reflection, agents repeat mistakes. With it, they improve with each iteration and maintain the quality standards banking requires.

## Tool Use     
Agents without access to external systems are limited to what they learned during training. Tool Use gives agents direct access to your APIs, databases, and systems to ground their actions in current, accurate information.

Research demonstrates that LLMs cannot reliably self-verify factual information—external tools provide the ground truth needed for accurate verification, improving performance by 7-8% points over self-critique alone.^2^

**Best for:** Tasks requiring access to external systems, current information, or specialized capabilities. Essential when agents need to bridge the gap between 
reasoning and real-world action.

![**Figure:** A loan processing agent orchestrates multiple systems—pulling credit data, checking fraud indicators, and updating core banking—without human coordination.](images/tooluse-pattern.png)

The agent decides when to use which tool based on task requirements. A loan processing agent might call a credit bureau for credit history, query a fraud detection system for risk indicators, check compliance databases for regulatory requirements, and update the core banking system with the decision—all without human coordination at each step.

> Tool use breaks agents free from their training data limitations. Now they can interact with the real systems that run your business.


## Planning     
Multi-step goals need structure. Without planning, agents jump between tasks or skip steps. Planning breaks complex problems into sequences—agents map the approach before executing.

**Best for:** Multi-step problems where order matters and where breaking the problem into phases improves success rates. Essential when tasks have dependencies or when parallel execution can improve efficiency.

![**Figure:** Agents don't just follow scripts—they create plans, execute tasks, evaluate results, and adapt when goals aren't met.](images/PlanningPattern.png)

A commercial loan application requires multiple verification steps: document extraction, financial analysis, credit scoring, industry benchmarking, and collateral valuation. Effective planning manages dependencies—financial analysis can't begin until documents are extracted, but once complete, credit scoring, benchmarking, and collateral valuation can run in parallel. The agent plans this execution strategy upfront rather than discovering dependencies through trial and error.

> Planning prevents wasted work from executing tasks in the wrong order or repeating steps. In banking, where each verification may involve expensive API calls or human review, planning the optimal execution path saves both time and cost.


## Multi-Agent Collaboration     
Complex problems often require specialized expertise that no single agent possesses. The Multi-agent pattern coordinates specialized agents to tackle problems no single agent can handle alone.

Research demonstrates that multi-agent debate significantly improves performance over single agents, with accuracy gains of 7-16 percentage points across reasoning and factuality tasks when agents critique and refine each other's outputs.^3^

**Best for:** Complex problems requiring specialized expertise where task decomposition provides clear benefits. Multi-agent systems are expensive, high-latency, and difficult to debug. Reserve for tasks where the benefits of specialization clearly outweigh the operational complexity.

![**Figure:** Complex tasks require specialization. A supervisor agent coordinates specialist agents (market research, content creation, project management) toward a shared objective.](images/multi-agent-pattern.png)

A fraud investigation might deploy specialized agents: one analyzes transaction patterns, another reviews customer history, a third checks against known fraud databases, and a 
supervisor coordinates their findings into a comprehensive risk assessment. Each agent contributes expertise the others lack, and their collective analysis catches patterns no single agent would detect.

> Multi-agent systems work like loan committees—different specialists bring different expertise. But they're expensive to maintain. When something breaks, you might trace through 10-50+ agent calls to find the problem. Don't go multi-agent unless simpler patterns can't handle it.


## Human in the Loop
For high-stakes decisions, full automation isn't always appropriate—or legal. Human-in-the-loop lets agents handle analysis and recommendations while humans make final decisions at critical checkpoints. This meets regulatory requirements and still delivers real efficiency gains.

**Best for:** High-stakes decisions where errors have serious consequences or regulatory requirements mandate human oversight. Essential when accountability must rest with humans, not algorithms.

![**Figure:** Agents analyze and recommend, humans review and approve at critical decision points, maintaining accountability while gaining efficiency.](images/human-in-loop-pattern.png)


Required in banking: Loan approvals, credit limit increases, account closures, fraud confirmations, compliance violations—any decision that significantly affects a customer's financial life or triggers regulatory scrutiny. A loan underwriting agent might analyze credit history, calculate risk scores, evaluate debt-to-income ratios, check compliance requirements, and recommend approval terms with detailed reasoning. But a human underwriter reviews the analysis and makes the final decision. The agent handles the time-consuming analysis across multiple data sources; the human applies judgment, considers context the model might miss, and takes responsibility for the outcome.
A fraud investigation agent might flag suspicious transactions, gather supporting evidence from multiple systems, analyze patterns against known fraud schemes, and calculate confidence scores. But a human fraud analyst reviews the evidence, considers customer context, and makes the final determination to block transactions or contact the customer. The agent accelerates investigation; the human prevents false positives that damage customer relationships.

> This isn't optional in banking. Human-in-the-loop maintains regulatory compliance, preserves accountability, and prevents reputational damage from bad automated decisions. In many cases, it's legally required.

**Real systems combine patterns:** A fraud detection system might use planning to structure its investigation, tool use to query transaction databases and threat feeds, reflection to validate its confidence in flagged cases, and multi-agent collaboration to coordinate with customer service and compliance systems. The supervisor agent ensures all pieces work together toward accurate fraud detection while maintaining audit trails for regulators.


# Choosing the Right Pattern

Not every problem needs full autonomy. Here's how to decide:

## Quick Selection Guide

| **Your Situation**                                   | **Use This Pattern**                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Predictable multi-step workflow                      | Planning + Tool Use                    |
| High-stakes decision requiring approval              | Planning + Human in Loop               |
| Customer service with varied requests                | Routing + Tool Use                     |
| Investigation where each step reveals next action    | ReAct + Tool Use                       |
| Output needs quality control                         | Add Reflection                         |
| Requires specialized expertise                       | Multi-Agent (use sparingly)           |

## Banking Essentials  
Keep humans in the loop for loan approvals, fraud confirmations, or anything that affects a customer's financial life. Build in reflection for regulatory reports—you need that quality check. And maintain audit trails for every agent decision. It's not optional; regulators will ask for them. 

> **Start Simple: ** Begin with the simplest pattern that might work. Add complexity only when you have clear evidence it's needed. Multi-agent systems can require analyzing 10–50+ LLM calls to debug a single failure. Start with Planning or Routing, add patterns as needed.

# Where Agentic AI Works Today
Agentic AI is already deployed in production settings:

**Financial Services** — Banks are running agentic systems for loan processing, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring. Teams are saving 60-80% on routine workflows and cutting manual coordination costs significantly.

**Healthcare** — Clinical documentation, treatment protocol recommendations, patient monitoring, and insurance claims processing. Organizations report 67% reduction in documentation time and 80% automation of routine claims processing, with some incident investigations processed for less than $1 per incident.

**Software Development** — Code generation and review, bug diagnosis, test case creation, and deployment automation. Development teams report 60% reduction in QA time and requirements design cycles dropping from weeks to days.

**Customer Operations** — Inquiry resolution, escalation routing, sentiment analysis, and proactive outreach. Agents handle tier-1 support while humans focus on complex cases requiring judgment and empathy.

# Conclusion

Agents handle structured complexity while humans handle judgment calls. As these systems improve, that boundary will shift, but the principle holds—agents excel at coordinating many moving parts, humans excel at navigating ambiguity and stakeholder relationships.
