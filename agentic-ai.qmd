# Introduction

AI systems are gaining autonomy. The latest wave—Agentic AI—doesn't just answer questions or generate content on command. These systems plan, decide, and act on their own to achieve goals you set. Think of the difference between asking someone for directions versus hiring them to get you there. The first requires you to do the work. The second handles the complexity for you.

This shift from reactive to proactive intelligence changes how organizations can deploy AI. Instead of building workflows around what the model can do in a single interaction, you can assign objectives and let the system figure out how to accomplish them. That capability is already reshaping operations in financial services, healthcare, customer support, and software development.

## What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems act with intent and autonomy to achieve defined goals. The key distinction: they don't just respond to commands—they pursue objectives.

Ask a generative AI system to "help with loan processing" and you'll get advice, templates, or summaries. Give an agentic system the same objective and it will actually process loans: pulling applicant data, running credit checks, calculating risk scores, checking compliance requirements, and flagging exceptions for human review. One provides information. The other completes work.

This difference matters because it changes what you can delegate to AI. Traditional systems require you to orchestrate each step. Generative systems require you to prompt for each output. Agentic systems let you specify the outcome and trust the system to figure out how to get there.

> Consider how a loan application moves through a bank. A traditional system routes the application through fixed decision points. A generative AI chatbot might answer questions about loan requirements. An agentic system actually processes the application—pulling credit data, verifying employment, calculating risk-adjusted pricing, checking compliance rules, and routing exceptions to human reviewers when needed. The difference isn't just scale. It's whether the system can navigate complexity without constant human intervention.


| **AI Type**       | **What It Does**                                               | **Key Limitation**                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Traditional AI    | Executes predefined rules or predictions from trained models   | Can't adapt to tasks outside its training scope             |
| Generative AI     | Creates content (text, images, code) based on learned patterns | Reactive: requires explicit prompts for each step          |
| Agentic AI        | Pursues goals through multi-step planning and decision-making  | Requires oversight to prevent unintended autonomous actions |

What makes this autonomy possible? Agentic systems combine several capabilities that earlier AI generations handled separately or not at all: maintaining context across interactions (memory), breaking complex goals into subtasks (planning), accessing external tools and data sources (tool use), and improving based on outcomes (learning). Section 3 explains how these capabilities work together in practice.

# How Agentic AI Works

Understanding what makes a system "agentic" is one thing. Seeing how it actually operates is another. Agentic systems run in a continuous cycle—perceiving their environment, reasoning about options, planning actions, executing through tools, and learning from results. This isn't a one-time sequence. It's an ongoing loop that adapts as conditions change.

**Perceive** — The agent gathers data from available sources: databases, APIs, document repositories, sensor feeds, or user inputs. Memory systems store relevant context from prior interactions and decisions.

**Reason** — A reasoning engine (typically a large language model) analyzes the current state, evaluates options, and determines the best approach given the goal and constraints. This isn't simple pattern matching—it involves weighing tradeoffs, anticipating consequences, and selecting strategies.

**Plan** — The planner breaks complex objectives into discrete tasks, sequences them logically, and identifies dependencies. Consider a loan approval goal. The agent might plan to: verify identity, pull credit history, calculate debt-to-income ratio, check against underwriting guidelines, and route to human review if red flags emerge. Each step depends on the previous one, and the agent adjusts the sequence if something fails.

**Act** — Tool-use capabilities let the agent execute planned tasks by interacting with external systems. It might call an identity verification API, query a credit bureau database, run a calculation, update a CRM record, or send a notification. The agent chooses which tools to use based on what each step requires.

**Learn** — Feedback loops capture outcomes and adjust future behavior. If a particular sequence of checks consistently flags false positives, the system refines its approach. If certain customer segments respond better to specific communication timing, the agent adapts its strategy.

The cycle repeats continuously. A customer service agent might start with a standard response template, detect frustration in the customer's reply, shift to a different communication strategy, pull additional account context, and adjust its tone—all within a single conversation thread. Each iteration informs the next.

This cycle runs continuously. For instance, a customer service agent may detect tone changes, shift strategies, pull additional context, and adjust its language—all within a single interaction.

# Agentic Design Patterns

Production-grade agentic systems rely on core design patterns:

- **Reflection**: Evaluate whether prior actions were successful and adjust reasoning.
- **Tool Use**: Call external APIs or tools when internal knowledge isn't enough.
- **Planning**: Develop a task plan before execution, revising it as conditions change.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Delegate tasks to specialized agents that share context and coordinate.

Most systems combine these patterns in production. For example, a fraud detection system might plan its workflow, use tools for verification, reflect on its risk score thresholds, and coordinate with agents handling customer outreach or compliance.

# Where Agentic AI Works Today
Agentic AI is already deployed in production settings:

- **Financial Services**: End-to-end loan processing, fraud detection, portfolio rebalancing
- **Healthcare**: Clinical documentation, treatment recommendations, patient monitoring
- **Software Development**: Code review, bug triage, test generation, deployment automation
- **Customer Operations**: Inquiry handling, escalation, proactive outreach, routing
- **Supply Chain**: Inventory planning, vendor negotiation, route optimization

## Example: Loan Origination & Operations

- **Data Integration**: Real-time data from economic, behavioral, regulatory, and sentiment sources
- **Decision Support**: Risk analysis, product bundling, anomaly detection
- **Operations Optimization**: Load balancing, intelligent routing, early warning systems
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Risk agents, pricing agents, compliance agents, communication agents working together
