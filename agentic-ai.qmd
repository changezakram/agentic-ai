# Introduction

AI systems are gaining autonomy. The latest wave—Agentic AI—doesn't just answer questions or generate content on command. These systems plan, decide, and act on their own to achieve goals you set. Think of the difference between asking someone for directions versus hiring them to get you there. The first requires you to do the work. The second handles the complexity for you.

This shift from reactive to proactive intelligence changes how organizations can deploy AI. Instead of building workflows around what the model can do in a single interaction, you can assign objectives and let the system figure out how to accomplish them. That capability is already reshaping operations in financial services, healthcare, customer support, and software development.

## What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems act with intent and autonomy to achieve defined goals. They don't just respond—they plan, decide, and adapt without step-by-step human direction.

The core capabilities that distinguish these systems:

- **Perception** — Understanding context from structured data, unstructured text, real-time feeds, and environmental signals
- **Memory** — Maintaining state across interactions, remembering past decisions, and building on previous context rather than starting fresh each time
- **Planning** — Decomposing complex objectives into sequenced tasks, anticipating dependencies, and adapting when conditions change
- **Tool Use** — Calling external APIs, querying databases, running calculations, and integrating with existing systems to extend their native capabilities
- **Learning** — Monitoring outcomes, adjusting strategies based on feedback, and improving performance over time through continuous optimization

> Consider how a loan application moves through a bank. A traditional system routes the application through fixed decision points. A generative AI chatbot might answer questions about loan requirements. An agentic system actually processes the application—pulling credit data, verifying employment, calculating risk-adjusted pricing, checking compliance rules, and routing exceptions to human reviewers when needed. The difference isn't just scale. It's whether the system can navigate complexity without constant human intervention.


| **AI Type**       | **What It Does**                                               | **Key Limitation**                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Traditional AI    | Executes predefined rules or predictions from trained models   | Can't adapt to tasks outside its training scope             |
| Generative AI     | Creates content (text, images, code) based on learned patterns | Reactive: requires explicit prompts for each step          |
| Agentic AI        | Pursues goals through multi-step planning and decision-making  | Requires oversight to prevent unintended autonomous actions |

# How Agentic AI Works

An agentic system operates in a continuous cycle, not a single pass. Each component enables specific capabilities within that loop:

- **Perceive** — Gather data from databases, APIs, document repositories, or user inputs; store relevant memory context.
- **Reason** — Use LLMs or reasoning engines to evaluate the current state and determine best options.
- **Plan** — Break complex objectives into tasks, sequence them, and identify dependencies.
- **Act** — Call tools, APIs, or other systems to execute planned steps.
- **Learn** — Capture outcomes and refine strategies over time.

This cycle runs continuously. For instance, a customer service agent may detect tone changes, shift strategies, pull additional context, and adjust language—all in real time.

# Agentic Design Patterns

Production-grade agentic systems rely on core design patterns:

- **Reflection**: Evaluate whether prior actions were successful and adjust reasoning.
- **Tool Use**: Call external APIs or tools when internal knowledge isn't enough.
- **Planning**: Develop a task plan before execution, revising it as conditions change.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Delegate tasks to specialized agents that share context and coordinate.

Most systems combine these patterns in production. For example, a fraud detection system might plan its workflow, use tools for verification, reflect on its risk score thresholds, and coordinate with agents handling customer outreach or compliance.

# Where Agentic AI Works Today
Agentic AI is already deployed in production settings:

- **Financial Services**: End-to-end loan processing, fraud detection, portfolio rebalancing
- **Healthcare**: Clinical documentation, treatment recommendations, patient monitoring
- **Software Development**: Code review, bug triage, test generation, deployment automation
- **Customer Operations**: Inquiry handling, escalation, proactive outreach, routing
- **Supply Chain**: Inventory planning, vendor negotiation, route optimization

## Example: Loan Origination & Operations

- **Data Integration**: Real-time data from economic, behavioral, regulatory, and sentiment sources
- **Decision Support**: Risk analysis, product bundling, anomaly detection
- **Operations Optimization**: Load balancing, intelligent routing, early warning systems
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Risk agents, pricing agents, compliance agents, communication agents working together
