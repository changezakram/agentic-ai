    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, and one of the most exciting developments is the emergence of Agentic AI. Unlike traditional AI systems that simply respond to input, Agentic AI systems can reason, plan, act, and adapt autonomously. This blog post will walk you through the basics of Agentic AI—what it is, how it works, how it differs from other AI approaches, and why it matters.\n\n\n\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent systems that act with intent, autonomy, and adaptability to achieve defined goals. Unlike traditional AI, these agents not only respond to commands but also plan, decide, and act proactively — often without step-by-step human direction.\nThey can perceive their environment, break down complex objectives into manageable tasks, interact with tools and APIs, and adapt their behavior based on feedback and context. In essence, they function as proactive collaborators, not just reactive assistants.\nGoogle Cloud defines agentic AI as systems with memory, planning, and tool-use capabilities, operating in dynamic feedback loops. IBM and McKinsey emphasize their role as organizational actors — capable of taking initiative, making decisions aligned with goals, and integrating seamlessly with human teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Type\nBehavior\nLimitation\n\n\n\n\nTraditional AI\nRule-based or ML-based automation\nRigid, task-specific\n\n\nGenerative AI\nGenerates text, images, audio, or video using LLMs, diffusion, GANs, etc.\nReactive: one prompt → one response\n\n\nAgentic AI\nGoal-oriented planning and action\nProactive, multi-step autonomy\n\n\n\nIBM describes the progression clearly: generative AI creates content across modalities, while agentic AI follows through on tasks by interpreting ambiguous instructions, planning multi-step workflows, and taking initiative.\nMcKinsey further notes that agentic systems assume decision-making responsibilities by incorporating context, risk, and organizational goals into their actions.\n\n\n\n\nAgentic AI follows a systematic process where each step is powered by key capabilities built into the system:\n\nPerceive — The agent collects and analyzes data from sensors, databases, and digital interfaces using its memory to understand the environment and identify key entities or patterns.\nReason — Using a reasoning engine (often an LLM) and contextual memory, the agent formulates plans, decomposes goals, and decides on the best course of action.\nPlan — Supported by its planner, the agent organizes the tasks into a logical sequence to achieve the objective.\nAct — The agent executes the planned tasks by interacting with external systems and APIs through its tool use capabilities.\nLearn — Through a continuous feedback loop and updated memory, the agent monitors outcomes, learns from them, and refines its models to improve future performance.\n\nThis integrated view shows how the components are not separate modules, but enablers embedded within the steps of the agent’s workflow, making the system proactive, adaptive, and goal-oriented.\n\n\n\n\nAgentic AI is already transforming industries, delivering measurable benefits and enabling capabilities beyond traditional and generative AI. Below are illustrative examples and data showing how organizations are adopting and benefiting from these systems.\n\n\nIn financial services, agentic AI systems orchestrate the loan origination journey end-to-end, going beyond traditional AI workflows or generative AI insights. These agents: - Ingest real-time data from macroeconomic trends, customer behavior, regulatory changes, and sentiment analysis. - Assess creditworthiness, adjust pricing, recommend optimal product bundles, and flag anomalies for human review. - Collaborate with other agents in fraud detection, compliance, and capital allocation to optimize outcomes.\nIn operations and customer service, agents dynamically rebalance workloads across call centers, resolve customer inquiries with contextual and emotionally intelligent responses, escalate only when human judgment is needed, and detect emerging patterns (e.g., loan performance divergence) before humans are even aware.\nIn multiagent systems, a decentralized network of agents collaborate — one assessing creditworthiness, another modeling risk exposure, and a third ensuring compliance — working together to optimize customer journeys and manage trade-offs in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Sector\nApprox.
