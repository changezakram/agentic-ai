    "text": "AI systems are gaining autonomy. The latest wave—Agentic AI—doesn’t just answer questions or generate content on command. These systems plan, decide, and act on their own to achieve goals you set. Think of the difference between asking someone for directions versus hiring them to get you there. The first requires you to do the work. The second handles the complexity for you.\nThis shift from reactive to proactive intelligence changes how organizations can deploy AI. Instead of building workflows around what the model can do in a single interaction, you can assign objectives and let the system figure out how to accomplish them. That capability is already reshaping operations in financial services, healthcare, customer support, and software development.\n\n\n\nAgentic AI systems act with intent and autonomy to achieve defined goals. The key distinction: they don’t just respond to commands—they pursue objectives.\nHere’s why this matters: it changes what you can delegate to AI. Traditional systems require you to orchestrate each step. Generative systems require you to prompt for each output. Agentic systems let you specify the outcome and trust the system to figure out how to get there.\n\nConsider how a loan application moves through a bank. A traditional system routes applications through fixed decision points. A generative AI chatbot might answer questions about loan requirements. An agentic system actually processes the application—pulling credit data, verifying employment, calculating risk-adjusted pricing, checking compliance rules, and routing exceptions to human reviewers when needed. The difference isn’t just scale. It’s whether the system can navigate complexity without constant human intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Type\nWhat It Does\nKey Limitation\n\n\n\n\nTraditional AI\nExecutes predefined rules or predictions from trained models\nCan’t adapt to tasks outside its training scope\n\n\nGenerative AI\nCreates content (text, images, code) based on learned patterns\nReactive: requires explicit prompts for each step\n\n\nAgentic AI\nPursues goals through multi-step planning and decision-making\nRequires oversight to prevent unintended autonomous actions\n\n\n\nAgentic systems combine several capabilities that earlier AI generations handled separately or not at all: maintaining context across interactions (memory), breaking complex goals into subtasks (planning), accessing external tools and data sources (tool use), and improving based on outcomes (learning)."
