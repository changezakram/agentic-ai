    "text": "Ten years ago, most companies worked with a few thousand rows of structured data per day — mainly clean records from CRMs, ERPs, and transactional systems. Today, mobile logs, app activity, and real-time streams push that number into the millions. The scale has changed entirely, yet teams are still trying to manage it with tools built for a slower world.\nInstead of driving strategy, Analytics Team spends mornings pulling data, afternoons building reports — and by the time insights are ready, the moment to act has passed. In fast-moving industries like retail, healthcare, and finance, that delay can cost you customers, revenue, and competitive edge.\nIt’s an efficiency trap. According to McKinsey, up to 80% of time in advanced analytics projects is spent just preparing data — not analyzing it. This needs to change."

It works well for regulatory reports, customer communications, and compliance documents that have clear quality standards.\n\n\n\nFigure: Reflection lets agents critique and improve their own output before delivering results—turning potential errors into learning opportunities.\n\n\nA customer service agent might review its drafted response for tone, clarity, and alignment with brand guidelines before sending. A credit analysis agent might validate whether its risk assessment considered all required factors and whether calculations are correct.

Effective planning manages dependencies—financial analysis can’t begin until documents are extracted, but once complete, credit scoring, benchmarking, and collateral valuation can run in parallel. The agent plans this execution strategy upfront rather than discovering dependencies through trial and error.\n\nPlanning prevents wasted work from executing tasks in the wrong order or repeating steps.
