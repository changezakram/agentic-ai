Unlike traditional AI systems that simply respond to input, Agentic AI systems can reason, plan, act, and adapt autonomously. This blog post will walk you through the basics of Agentic AI—what it is, how it works, how it differs from other AI approaches, and why it matters.\n\n\n\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent systems that act with intent, autonomy, and adaptability to achieve defined goals. Unlike traditional AI, these agents not only respond to commands but also plan, decide, and act proactively — often without step-by-step human direction.\nThey can perceive their environment, break down complex objectives into manageable tasks, interact with tools and APIs, and adapt their behavior based on feedback and context. In essence, they function as proactive collaborators, not just reactive assistants.\nGoogle Cloud defines agentic AI as systems with memory, planning, and tool-use capabilities, operating in dynamic feedback loops. IBM and McKinsey emphasize their role as organizational actors — capable of taking initiative, making decisions aligned with goals, and integrating seamlessly with human teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Type\nBehavior\nLimitation\n\n\n\n\nTraditional AI\nRule-based or ML-based automation\nRigid, task-specific\n\n\nGenerative AI\nGenerates text, images, audio, or video using LLMs, diffusion, GANs, etc.\nReactive: one prompt → one response\n\n\nAgentic AI\nGoal-oriented planning and action\nProactive, multi-step autonomy"

    "text": "3.1 Illustrative Example: Loan Origination & Operations\nIn financial services, agentic AI systems orchestrate the loan origination journey end-to-end, going beyond traditional AI workflows or generative AI insights. These agents: - Ingest real-time data from macroeconomic trends, customer behavior, regulatory changes, and sentiment analysis. - Assess creditworthiness, adjust pricing, recommend optimal product bundles, and flag anomalies for human review. - Collaborate with other agents in fraud detection, compliance, and capital allocation to optimize outcomes.\nIn operations and customer service, agents dynamically rebalance workloads across call centers, resolve customer inquiries with contextual and emotionally intelligent responses, escalate only when human judgment is needed, and detect emerging patterns (e.g., loan performance divergence) before humans are even aware.\nIn multiagent systems, a decentralized network of agents collaborate — one assessing creditworthiness, another modeling risk exposure, and a third ensuring compliance — working together to optimize customer journeys and manage trade-offs in real time."
