    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, and one of the most exciting developments is the emergence of Agentic AI. Unlike traditional AI systems that simply respond to input, Agentic AI systems can reason, plan, act, and adapt autonomously. This blog post will walk you through the basics of Agentic AI—what it is, how it works, how it differs from other AI approaches, and why it matters.\n\n\n\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent systems that act with intent, autonomy, and adaptability to achieve defined goals. Unlike traditional AI, these agents not only respond to commands but also plan, decide, and act proactively — often without step-by-step human direction.\nThey can perceive their environment, break down complex objectives into manageable tasks, interact with tools and APIs, and adapt their behavior based on feedback and context. In essence, they function as proactive collaborators, not just reactive assistants.\nGoogle Cloud defines agentic AI as systems with memory, planning, and tool-use capabilities, operating in dynamic feedback loops. IBM and McKinsey emphasize their role as organizational actors — capable of taking initiative, making decisions aligned with goals, and integrating seamlessly with human teams.\n\n“Agentic AI systems are dynamic, goal-seeking entities that can plan and act autonomously.” — IBM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Type\nBehavior\nLimitation\n\n\n\n\nTraditional AI\nRule-based or ML-based automation\nRigid, task-specific\n\n\nGenerative AI\nGenerates text, images, audio, or video using LLMs, diffusion, GANs, etc.\nReactive: one prompt → one response\n\n\nAgentic AI\nGoal-oriented planning and action\nProactive, multi-step autonomy\n\n\n\nIBM describes the progression clearly: generative AI creates content across modalities, while agentic AI follows through on tasks by interpreting ambiguous instructions, planning multi-step workflows, and taking initiative.\nMcKinsey further notes that agentic systems assume decision-making responsibilities by incorporating context, risk, and organizational goals into their actions.\n\n“Agentic AI combines generative power with goal decomposition, reasoning, and execution.” — IBM\n\n\n\n\n\nAgentic AI is made possible by combining several key components:\n\nReasoning Engine (usually an LLM)\n\nPlanner (to decompose goals)\n\nMemory (to retain context)\n\nTool Use (to interact with external systems)\n\nFeedback Loop (to adapt in real time)\n\nGoogle calls this an architecture of “reasoning, memory, tools, and planning.” IBM adds that these systems are typically built with a modular wrapper around a core LLM, which provides autonomy and coordination capabilities.\nMcKinsey takes this further by introducing a Decision-Making Maturity Model, showing how agents evolve from assistive to autonomous roles.\n\n\n\n\nAgentic AI is already transforming industries.
