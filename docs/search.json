    "text": "Ten years ago, most companies ran on a few thousand rows of structured data a day—mostly neat records from CRMs and ERPs. Today, mobile logs and real-time streams push that number into the millions. The scale has changed entirely, yet teams are still trying to manage it with tools built for a slower world.\nInstead of driving strategy, your team pulls data in the morning, builds reports in the afternoon—and by the time insights are ready, the moment to act has passed. In fast-moving industries like retail, healthcare, and finance, that delay can cost you customers, revenue, and competitive edge.\nIt’s an efficiency trap. According to McKinsey, up to 80% of time in advanced analytics projects is spent just preparing data — not analyzing it.\nThat needs to change."

That capability is already reshaping operations in financial services, healthcare, customer support, and software development.\n\n\n\nAgentic AI systems act with intent and autonomy to achieve defined goals.

Reflection lets agents evaluate and improve their outputs before delivering them—the same quality check that humans do.\nResearch shows that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 improve their outputs by ~20% through iterative self-feedback.[1] The key is structured evaluation criteria—specific feedback on what needs improvement drives better refinements than generic critique.\nBest for: Tasks where you need to check and improve quality before delivering. It works well for regulatory reports, customer communications, and compliance documents that have clear quality standards.\n\n\n\nFigure: Reflection lets agents critique and improve their own output before delivering results—turning potential errors into learning opportunities.\n\n\nA customer service agent might review its drafted response for tone, clarity, and alignment with brand guidelines before sending. A credit analysis agent might validate whether its risk assessment considered all required factors and whether calculations are correct. Each iteration catches errors that would otherwise reach customers or regulators.\n\nWithout reflection, agents repeat mistakes.

Essential when agents need to bridge the gap between reasoning and real-world action.\n\n\n\nFigure: A loan processing agent orchestrates multiple systems—pulling credit data, checking fraud indicators, and updating core banking—without human coordination.\n\n\nThe agent decides when to use which tool based on task requirements. A loan processing agent might call a credit bureau for credit history, query a fraud detection system for risk indicators, check compliance databases for regulatory requirements, and update the core banking system with the decision—all without human coordination at each step.\n\nTool use breaks agents free from their training data limitations.

Essential when tasks have dependencies or when parallel execution can improve efficiency.\n\n\n\nFigure: Agents don’t just follow scripts—they create plans, execute tasks, evaluate results, and adapt when goals aren’t met.\n\n\nA commercial loan application requires multiple verification steps: document extraction, financial analysis, credit scoring, industry benchmarking, and collateral valuation. Effective planning manages dependencies—financial analysis can’t begin until documents are extracted, but once complete, credit scoring, benchmarking, and collateral valuation can run in parallel. The agent plans this execution strategy upfront rather than discovering dependencies through trial and error.\n\nPlanning prevents wasted work from executing tasks in the wrong order or repeating steps. In banking, where each verification may involve expensive API calls or human review, planning the optimal execution path saves both time and cost."

A supervisor agent coordinates specialist agents (market research, content creation, project management) toward a shared objective.\n\n\nTake an example of fraud investigation. One agent analyzes transactions, another checks customer history, a third searches fraud databases. A supervisor coordinates their findings.
